# node-deployment-workshop

This is a sample repository of a basic node chat server application. The aim of this Digimakers workshop is to teach participants some basic web technology concepts.

As technology progresses we are moving away from traditional server design paradigms such as LAMP stacks (Linux Apache MySQL and PHP) into the more modern and responsive world of javascript and Node. This tutorial will equip participants with the skills required to:

- Use Koding.com
- Install Node.js
- Use npm (Node Package Manager)
- Set up a basic chat server with socket.io
- Set up a web hosting environment (Apache, Node or Python)
- Use bower to install useful frameworks
- Play with bootstrap to build a beautiful website

This is a basic framework which gives participants a head-start with Node and shows some of the basics of interactive web programming. We hope it helps!
